### Solarized Dark - Patched

Some applications assume the ANSI color code 8 is a gray color. Solarized treats
this code as equal to the background. This theme is for people who prefer the
former. See issues [#59][issue-59], [#62][issue-62], and [#63][issue-63] for
more information.

## Credits

The schemes Novel, Espresso, Grass, Homebrew, Ocean, Pro, Man Page, Red Sands, and Terminal Basic are ports of the schemes of the same name included with the Mac Terminal application. All of Terminal's schemes have now been ported, with the exception of "Solid Colors" (random backgrounds, which iTerm doesn't support) and "Aerogel" (which is hideous).

The scheme Violet was created by [ashfinal](https://github.com/ashfinal/vim-colors-violet).

The scheme idleToes was inspired by the [idleFingers](http://www.idlefingers.co.uk/) TextMate theme and suggested for inclusion by Seth Wilson.

The scheme Zenburn was inspired by the [Zenburn](http://sunaku.github.io/zenburn-terminal-color-scheme.html) version created by Suraj N. Kurapati.

The scheme Symfonic was inspired by the color scheme used in the [documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/index.html) for the [Symfony](http://www.symfony.com) PHP Framework.

The synthwave theme was created by [brettstil](https://github.com/brettstil/)

The scheme Github was inspired by the color theme palette used at [Github](https://github.com/) for their UI and in some of their mascot images.

The scheme Solarized Darcula was inspired by the color theme created by [@rickhanlonii](https://github.com/rickhanlonii). There are two screenshots below; one with a background and one without. The background image is included in the backgrounds/ directory and the image must be manually set on the profile's Preferences->Window tab. It's hard to see from the screenshot, but it looks great!

The theme Hurtado was found [here](https://github.com/juanghurtado/dotfiles).

### Terminator color schemes

Edit your Terminator configuration file (located in: `$HOME/.config/terminator/config`) and add the configurations for the theme(s) you'd like to use the `[profiles]` section. The `terminator/` directory contains the config snippets you'll need. Just paste the configurations into the `[profiles]` sections, and you're good to go!

At a minimum, this is all you need. You can customize the fonts and other aspects as well, if you wish. See the Terminator documentation for more details.

An example config file that includes the code snippet for the Symfonic theme would look like this:

```ini
[global_config]
    [keybindings]
    [profiles]
      [[default]]
        palette = "#1a1a1a:#f4005f:#98e024:#fa8419:#9d65ff:#f4005f:#58d1eb:#c4c5b5:#625e4c:#f4005f:#98e024:#e0d561:#9d65ff:#f4005f:#58d1eb:#f6f6ef"
        background_image = None
        use_system_font = False
        cursor_color = "#f6f7ec"
        foreground_color = "#c4c5b5"
        font = Source Code Pro Light 11
        background_color = "#1a1a1a"
      [[Symfonic]]
        palette = "#000000:#dc322f:#56db3a:#ff8400:#0084d4:#b729d9:#ccccff:#ffffff:#1b1d21:#dc322f:#56db3a:#ff8400:#0084d4:#b729d9:#ccccff:#ffffff"
        background_color = "#000000"
        cursor_color = "#dc322f"
        foreground_color = "#ffffff"
        background_image = None
    [layouts]
      [[default]]
        [[[child1]]]
          type = Terminal
          parent = window0
        [[[window0]]]
          type = Window
          parent = ""
    [plugins]
```

### Konsole color schemes

Copy the themes from the `konsole` directory to `$HOME/.config/konsole` (in some versions of KDE, the theme directory may be located at `$HOME/.local/share/konsole`), restart Konsole and choose your new theme from the profile preferences window.

If you want to make the themes available to all users, copy the .colorscheme files to `/usr/share/konsole`.

### Terminal color schemes

Just double click on selected theme in `terminal` directory

### PuTTY color schemes

#### New Session Method

This method creates a new blank session with JUST colors set properly.

Download the appropriate `colorscheme.reg` file and import the registry changes by right-clicking and choosing Merge. Choose "Yes" when prompted if you're sure. Color scheme will show up as a new PuTTY session with all defaults except entries at `Window > Colours > Adjust the precise colours PuTTY displays`.

#### Modify Session Method

This method modifies an existing session and changes JUST the color settings.

Download the appropriate `colorscheme.reg` file. Open the file with a text editor and change the color scheme portion (`Molokai` below) to match the session you want to modify:

```
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\Molokai]
- CHANGE TO (EXAMPLE) -
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\root@localhost]
```

**NOTE**: Some special characters will need to be changed to their Percent-encoded representation (IE, Space as `%20`). To quickly find the right session name view the top-level entries at `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\` with `regedit.exe`.

#### Other PuTTY Recommendations

```
Window > Apprearance
	Font: Consolas, bold, 14-point
	Font quality:
		( ) Antialiased     ( ) Non-Antialiased
		(O) ClearType       ( ) Default
Window > Colours
	[X] Allow terminal to specify ANSI colours
	[X] Allow terminal to use xterm 256-colour mode
	Indicate bolded text by changing:
		( ) The font   (O) The colour   ( ) Both
	[ ] Attempt to use logical palettes
	[ ] Use system colours
```

### Xfce Terminal color schemes

Copy the `colorschemes` folder to `~/.local/share/xfce4/terminal/` and restart Terminal.

### FreeBSD vt color schemes

Append your favourite theme from `freebsd_vt/` to `/boot/loader.conf`
or `/boot/loader.conf.local` and reboot.

### MobaXterm color schemes

Copy the theme content from `mobaxterm/` and paste the content to your `MobaXterm.ini` in the corresponding place (`[Colors]`).

### LXTerminal color schemes

Copy the theme content from `lxterminal/` and paste the content to your `lxterminal` in the corresponding place (`[general]`).

### Visual Studio Code color schemes

Copy the theme content from `vscode/` and paste the content to your [UserSettings.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings).

### Windows Terminal color schemes

Copy the theme content from `windowsterminal/` and paste the content to your `profiles.json` in the corresponding place (`"schemes"`). Then specify the name of your theme by `"colorScheme"` in `"profiles"`.

### Alacritty color schemes

Copy the theme content from `alacritty/` and paste the content to your [alacritty config file](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/master/alacritty.yml).

### Previewing color schemes

[preview.rb](tools/preview.rb) is a simple script that allows you to preview
the color schemes without having to import them. It parses .itermcolors files
and applies the colors to the current session using [iTerm's proprietary
escape codes](https://iterm2.com/documentation-escape-codes.html). As noted in
the linked page, it doesn't run on tmux or screen.

```sh
# Apply AdventureTime scheme to the current session
tools/preview.rb schemes/AdventureTime.itermcolors

# Apply the schemes in turn.
# - Press (almost) any key to advance; hit CTRL-C or ESC to stop
# - Press the delete key to go back
tools/preview.rb schemes/*
```
