## Credits
The schemes Novel, Espresso, Grass, Homebrew, Ocean, Pro, Man Page, Red Sands, and Terminal Basic are ports of the schemes of the same name included with the Mac Terminal application. All of Terminal's schemes have now been ported, with the excption of "Solid Colors" (random backgrounds, which iTerm doesn't support) and "Aerogel" (which is hideous).

The scheme idleToes was inspired by the [idleFingers](http://idlefingers.co.uk/) TextMate theme and suggested for inclusion by Seth Wilson.

The scheme Zenburn was inspired by the [Zenburn](http://snk.tuxfamily.org/log/zenburn-terminal-color-scheme.html) version created by Suraj N. Kurapati.

The scheme Symfonic was inspired by the color scheme used in the [documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/index.html) for the [Symfony](http://www.symfony.com) PHP Framework.

The scheme Github was inspired by the color theme palette used at [Github](http://github.com/) for their UI and in some of their mascot images.

The scheme Solarized Darcula was inspired by the color theme created by [@rickhanlonii](https://github.com/rickhanlonii). There are two screenshots below; one with a background and one without. The background image is included in the backgrounds/ directory and the image must be manually set on the profile's Preferences->Window tab. It's hard to see from the screenshot, but it looks great!

The theme Hurtado was found [here](https://github.com/juanghurtado/dotfiles).

The theme Molokai was based on the [vim colorscheme](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai) of the same name.

###Terminator color schemes###

Edit your Terminator configuration file (located in: `$HOME/.config/terminator/config`) and add the configurations for the theme(s) you'd like to use the ``[profiles]`` section. The `terminator/` directory contains the config snippets you'll need. Just paste the configurations into the `[profiles]` sections, and you're good to go!  

At a minimum, this is all you need. You can customize the fonts and other aspects as well, if you wish. See the Terminator documentation for more details.

An example config file that includes the code snippet for the Symfonic theme would look like this:

```ini
[global_config]
    [keybindings]
    [profiles]
      [[default]]
        palette = "#1a1a1a:#f4005f:#98e024:#fa8419:#9d65ff:#f4005f:#58d1eb:#c4c5b5:#625e4c:#f4005f:#98e024:#e0d561:#9d65ff:#f4005f:#58d1eb:#f6f6ef"
        background_image = None
        use_system_font = False
        cursor_color = "#f6f7ec"
        foreground_color = "#c4c5b5"
        font = Source Code Pro Light 11
        background_color = "#1a1a1a"
      [[Symfonic]]
        palette = "#000000:#dc322f:#56db3a:#ff8400:#0084d4:#b729d9:#ccccff:#ffffff:#1b1d21:#dc322f:#56db3a:#ff8400:#0084d4:#b729d9:#ccccff:#ffffff"
        background_color = "#000000"
        cursor_color = "#dc322f"
        foreground_color = "#ffffff"
        background_image = None
    [layouts]
      [[default]]
        [[[child1]]]
          type = Terminal
          parent = window0
        [[[window0]]]
          type = Window
          parent = ""
    [plugins]
```
