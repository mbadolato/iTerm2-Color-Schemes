# This is based on Kate Morley's 12-bit rainbow palette
# https://iamkate.com/data/12-bit-rainbow/
#
# It does not _strictly_ follow the palette, which does not include blacks and
# whites; if we stuck strictly to the palette, the closest thing to white would
# be yellow, and to black a sort of purple. This palette keeps some
# monochromatic colors in here, if for no other reason that they have "white"
# and "black" in their names.
